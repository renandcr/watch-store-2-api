## üíª Quick start

To run this project you will need a good code editor, my suggestion is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). In addition, you will also need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine.

Clone the remote repository on your machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:renandcr/watch-store-2-api.git
```

<br>

Enter the local repository:

```
cd watch-store-2-api
```

<br>

Open the code editor in the project's root folder:

```
code .
```

<br>

Follow the instructions described in the .env.example file and add all environment variables inside an .env file. For this, you will need to create an .env file in the root of the project:

<img alt="Example of directories" src="src/assets/readme/images/example_of_directories.png"/>

<br>

Run the following command in the terminal to run the cloud project:

```
docker compose up
```

<br>

If all goes well, you should see this:

<img alt="Example of directories" src="src/assets/readme/images/run_docker_compose.png"/>

Ready, the project is running in a docker container with all the necessary dependencies for its operation.

Use "Ctrl + C" to stop the server.
