## Quick start

To run a project in React, you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. In addition, you will also need a good code editor. My suggestion is the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Clone the remote repository on your machine:

```
git@github.com:renandcr/watch-store-design.git
```

<br>

Enter the local repository:

```
cd watch-store-design
```

<br>

Install in your local repository the project dependencies:

```
yarn
```

<br>

Open the text editor in the project's root folder:

```
code .
```

<br>

In your text editor terminal, run the server:

```
yarn start
```

Use "Ctrl + C" to stop the server.
